 * A base class for indicator series with simple calculations that separates the calculation
 * responsibility from the other responsibilities of the financial series, this enables
 * easier unit testing and decoupling of individual calculation strategies.
 * A contract is defined between the financial series and these simple indicator calculations
 * detailing the data which the series agrees to provide the simple indicator calculations,
 * this contract is defined by FinancialCalculationDataSource. If more
 * complex interactions are needed between the indicator calculation and the series, the
 * indicators should instead derive from FinancialIndicator directly, or some
 * derivative other than StrategyBasedIndicator
